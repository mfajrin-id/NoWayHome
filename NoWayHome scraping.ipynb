      "full_review: As a person who hasn't seen every Marvel film there is, my son had me watch the second in this series. That allowed me to understand (to a point) what was going on. There are so many characters with so much baggage that the casual viewer almost needs a program to understand. Nevertheless, there is lots of action, suspense, decent character development, and endless special effects. I was bewildered by the plot because of all this \"multi-verse\" stuff. I have to teach myself that if another franchise has already developed Spiderman and the villains, this series may have only a passing connection.\n",

      "full_review: There is so much to unpack here. And I understand that some people may not be into the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, but it is apparent how much almost everyone loves this movie. And as you can tell I am one of them. Now you could dismiss my opinion, since I have clearly bought and swallowed the MCU pill (I openly admit liking and being a fan boy of what has been created there - you can hate me or simply agree with me, all opinions are welcome) ... but I dare anyone who has seen all Spider Man movies, not to feel at least something rather positive about this.It does take many good things from previous efforts (no pun intended) and gets the best out of them. It does a great service to the (movie) history of Spider-Man. But also showing us a different side of a Marvel hero ... a side that is vulnerable in a way we have not seen yet. Or not in that form - the identity crisis and the good deeds that do not go unpunished ... or do they? Tom Holland has been exposed - something you know if you've seen the previous Spider-Man movie ... and while his mentor Iron Man dealt differently with that fame - recognition, Peter Parker as we know him, can not deal with it the same way.Add to that, that he wants to help people as much as he can (a bit of a difference to what Tony Stark stood for most of the time, being self centered and and self serving) - and you have a dangerous combination. There is a reason the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies are being compared with 80s teen comedies - there are many parallels (John Hughes and others are being name dropped in those conversations). And while there is a lot of action (the mirror world scene has so many \"climactic\" scenes I probably did not close my mouth the entire time it was happening), the movie also takes its time to give us little character moments.And a lot of fan service - this movie celebrates what came before. It celebrates and takes its audience seriously. But in a fun and entertaining way. Yes it is not all fun and games and there are a lot of callbacks (no pun intended) - there is drama, there may be even some head shaking at how naive Peter Parker seems ... but it makes sense in the realm of the world that was built around him and the character that he is - there is an evolution, but he can't help himself - being who he is and who he grew up to be. For better or worse ... yes the famous line will be uttered and it will have a sad undertone to it. But the movie is able to give you so much, that even when you know something completely horrible is about to happen, you also know that some lighter moments will follow.That being said, it takes nothing away from the performance by Tom Holland, who has to play vulnerable, playful, ecstatic, experimental, shy and giving/helpful ... while a lot has been made of who is going to be in the movie (or not) - it is his movie. Yes there are many things that you can tear apart and make fun of - there are logic issues if you want to call them that ... but in a world where \"magic\" exists ... are you really going to nitpick? Maybe you will, which would be a shame - because you'll be missing out on one hell of a movie and a ride that is truly amazing - no pun intended.It is also amazing that Sony and Disney reached a deal - so that Marvel can continue to use Spiderman in their universe. But not just him ... it seems there is way more to come. And while having many throwbacks (and callbacks) and bringing them all to a conclusion of sorts ... well while all that could mean that this could be a nice way to end Tom Hollands reign as Spider-Man ... it could just as easily continue. The possibilities are endless going forward.As you can tell I am not one to spoil or say anything that is revealing. That is why I did not talk about the cast and the cameos - most of them were revealed ahead of time. Either officially (villains) or just through rumors (no matter how much denying went on - we knew ... we just knew) ... but there was a cameo that most did not see coming - pun very much intended.If you watched this in a cinema (which I can only highly recommend to do), you will probably still have goosebumps. You either cheered yourself loudly at quite a few moments (or gasped at others) ... or just enjoyed silently ... what a movie experience that was. One that I might repeat in cinemas - a treat I do not give myself too often, because I tend to let a bit of time pass before I rewatch something after the first time viewing ... but there are exceptions and this might very well be one of them ... Spider-Man you Sir ... are one of the good ones! Pun again intended - because you too are amazing ...\n",

      "short review: Spider-Man: No Way Home\n",
      "full_review: The new interpretation of Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe was introduced in Captain America: Civil War, then he went solo in the fantastic Homecoming, and his second film Far from Home was good, this was his third outing, and I was most excited about it. Basically, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) has been framed for murder and had his secret identity as Spider-Man posthumously revealed by Quentin Beck aka Mysterio. Peter, his girlfriend Michelle \"MJ\" Jones (Zendaya), his best friend Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon), and his aunt May (Marisa Tomei) are interrogated by the Department of Damage Control. The charges are dropped with the help of lawyer Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) (from TV's Daredevil), but the group must deal with the negative publicity. Peter has become the most famous face across the world, he cannot handle the pressure of the attention from everyone at school, and everybody else. But it is much worse when he finds out that he, MJ, and Ned are rejected for their applications to get into MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Wanting things to go back to the way they were, Peter goes to the New York Sanctum to ask Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help. Peter asks if it would be possible to cast a spell that would make everyone in the world forget that he is Spider-Man. As Strange begins the spell, Peter repeatedly requests to stop certain loved ones from forgetting his secret identity, which corrupts the spell. Strange is forced to contain the spell before it goes catastrophic and makes Peter leave. Peter finds the MIT Assistant Vice Chancellor (Paula Newsome) and requests her to reconsider MJ and Ned's applications, but he is suddenly attacked by Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) aka Dr. Octopus / \"Doc Ock\". Octavius rips Peter's nanotechnology from his Iron Spider suit, which bonds with his mechanical tentacles and allows Peter to disable them. Then Norman Osborn aka Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) arrives and attacks, before Strange teleports Peter back to the Sanctum, locking Octavius in a cell opposite Dr. Curt Connors aka The Lizard (Rhys Ifans). Strange explains that the corrupted spell summoned people from other universes who know Spider-Man's identity, and orders Parker, MJ, and Ned to find and capture them. While Max Dillon aka Electro (Jamie Foxx) and Flint Marko aka Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) fight with Peter but eventually captured, Osborn reclaims control of himself from his split Green Goblin personality. He is comforted by May at a F. E. A. S. T. (Food, Emergency Aid, Shelter & Training) building before being retrieved by Peter. While discussing their battles with Spider-Man, Osborn, Octavius, and Dillon realise that they were pulled from their universes just before their deaths. Strange prepares a spell that will send the villains back to their respective universes, but Peter argues that they should first be cured of their destructive and evil powers to prevent their deaths upon their return. Unable to convince Strange, Peter steals the boxed spell, traps Strange in the Mirror Dimension, and goes with May and the villains to the apartment of her boyfriend, Harold \"Happy\" Hogan (Jon Favreau), head of security for Stark Industries. Peter uses Stark Industries technology to cure Octavius of the voices of the mechanical tenticles overwhelming his judgement, but Osborn's Goblin persona takes control and convinces the uncured villains to betray Peter. As Dillon, Marko, and Connors escape, May is fatally wounded by Osborn, she Peter \"with great power, there must also come great responsibility\" before she dies. Ned finds Strange's sling ring and discovers the ability to create portals, which he and MJ use to try to locate Parker. They instead find two other versions of Peter Parker, also summoned by Strange's spell. For the sake of stopping any confusion, the Peter from Osborn, Octavius, and Marko's universe (Tobey Maguire) is nicknamed \"Peter-Two\", and the other from Connors and Dillon's universe (Andrew Garfield) is nicknamed \"Peter-Three\". Ned and MJ find Peter and comfort him while the other Peters share stories of losing loved ones; they encourage Peter to fight in May's honour. The three Peters develop cures for the villains using Stark Industries technology, and Dillon, Marko, and Connors are lured to the Statue of Liberty. While Marko and Connors are cured by Peter-Two and Peter, Octavius arrives to help and cures Dillon. Ned frees Strange from the Mirror Dimension, but Osborn arrives and destroys the boxed spell, rupturing the barrier separating universes. While Strange maintains the barrier, an enraged Peter tries to kill Osborn, but Peter-Two stops him. Peter-Three and Peter inject Osborn with his cure, and his sanity is restored. Parker realises that the only way to protect the multiverse is to erase himself from everyone's memory and allows Strange to do so, and he says his goodbyes to MJ and Ned and promises he will find them again. The spell is cast, everyone is returned to their respective universe, including (in the mid-credits) Eddie Brock aka Venom (Tom Hardy), leaving behind a piece of his symbiote substance. Two weeks later, Peter finds MJ and Ned in a coffee shop, but he decides against reintroducing himself to them. He goes to May's grave, and has a brief conversation with Hogan, after which he is inspired to carry on, making a new suit and resuming himself as a vigilante. Also starring J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, Benedict Wong as Wong, Tony Revolori as Flash Thompson, Angourie Rice as Betty Brant, Hannibal Buress as Coach Wilson, Martin Starr as Mr. Harrington, J. B. Smoove as Mr. Dell, and Gary Weeks as Agent Foster. Holland continues to be a stable choice as the web-slinging hero, Cumberbatch is good as the time-manipulating scientist, Zendaya and Batalon do well as the hero's girlfriend and best friend, and there is nothing but praise for Maguire and Garfield returning as fellow Spider-Mans, and Molina, Dafoe, Foxx and the others as the villains, all from the multiverse. This is among the best scripted films in the franchise, with a clever story involving science and technology, fate and destiny, it will satisfy everybody looking for excitement, with an array of amazing special effects taking you through the many worlds, good moments of humour and emotion, and of course the reappearance of recognisable faces from past Marvel films will be a treat for the fans, a must-see superhero fantasy action adventure. Very good!\n",

      "short review: Somehow better than Endgame\n",
      "full_review: It's hard to discuss this movie and not get into the spoilers because the biggest moments of this movie necessitate ruining several of the big reveals. I loved that not everything was in the trailer and I successfully avoided reading too much about the film, which helped my enjoyment. This was the first movie I've seen in a theater since Halloween Kills, so the risk of COVID-19 and all its variants didn't keep me away* from the biggest movie of the year.This movie arrives as so many older directors gatekeep what constitutes a movie. So let me break down my opinion: movies can be anything you want them to be. There is equal room for a high end Oscar contender as there is for the junk low end world that I live in, the places where Godfrey Ho, Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei make their home.What else are comic book movies other than classical myths made with computers and no small amount of sound and fury? So yeah, this is the 27th Marvel Cinematic Universe movie and you know, you don't have to watch these movies. Hollywood -- the world -- is still making something for everyone. But for crowd-pleasing moments, the two biggest I've heard in years are when Captain America lifted Mjolnir and when one of the characters arrived in this film, a literally explosion of happiness and joy from an audience that has weathered so much in the last two years.And isn't that why movies exist? To make us feel something?No movie that I have seen in a theater in nearly a decade has elicited that emotional outburst and you know, it brought true joy to my heart. So I didn't feel silly expressing my emotions, whether they were happy when a certain legal professional made his presence known or the sadness of Dr. Strange's final words to Peter Parker.Spider-Man has always lived by the lesson that with great power comes great responsibility. He's a character informed -- in every incarnation -- by a great loss that he was at fault for and a lifetime of making up for that mistake.Yet Spider-Man: No Way Home presents us with something new. Great power with responsibility also means being better than your enemies and at times, working to make them better people and not just punching them into oblivion. The fact that antagonists can be worth saving spoke to me, someone usually given to mad revenge schemes and years of grudges. Even when doing the right thing ends up hurting you, you still can do the right thing.These are big concepts for a comic book spectacle. And this movie does what all great films should. It's stuck in my mind since I saw it and I wanted some time away from it before I wrote this. Spider-Man is the story of a bully grown up and moving past the way he was treated, often finding those bullies -- Flash Thompson, Eddie Brock -- become if not friends, certainly no longer enemies.This also gets into the Marvel idea of a multiverse, a connected web of other realities where small differences -- Disney+ set this up with What If...? And this idea will form the heart of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness -- but the main part of this story remains refreshingly human in the midst of big ideas, strange science and concepts like how magic works.Look -- I don't have to sell you on these movies. They make so much money that they're critic proof. But I do want you to consider that even if you hate superhero movies, even if you think there are too many of them, to consider your favorite film series. What if you had more than three of the original Star Wars films and they all were progressively better? What if the last Jason, Freddy or Hellraiser movie was so much better than the original? What if James Bond got more human, more relevant and more real as the world around him became even stranger?That's what's happening here. And it's amazing.*I'm triple vaxxed, beyond fastidious about mask wearing and personal space, and rarely if ever leave my movie basement. This isn't a political statement. Viruses don't have politics and if you think they do, you can kindly never read another word that I write.\n",

      "short review: A multi-verse of options...\n",
      "full_review: Aside from the \"Thor\" strand of Marvel features, the \"Spiderman\" stories were always my favourites. Regardless of the actors encased in red and blue lycra, the character has always had the most to offer - a sense of mischief with his tongue in his cheek. His superpower has always struck me as not being that great either, so there was a need for courage and a certain degree of gung-ho optimism from this most human of super-heroes. This latest iteration is certainly the best. Tom Holland has made the part his own - he even manages to spend the first few scenes in his boxers just to get the audience's attention before a couple of hours of fast-paced, colourful entertainment with one or two (dozen) spikes in the plot to keep it interesting. There is plenty of fun to be had watching this. The dialogue is frequently amusing as are the hammy contributions of Benedict Cumberbatch's \"Dr. Strange\" and a host of stars none of whom are taking anything at all seriously. There is no high-principled moralising, it's just escapism produced to the highest of standards with a lad in a costume who is clearly having a great time making a film that is shameless in it's desire to make us smile (or, indeed, cheer loudly as at my screening in London last week). I can't help but think that three is a bit of a magic number for the actors in the title role. The more we see of Tom Holland in other roles (and the more of him we see!) makes it a just that little bit more difficult for him - as was the case for Messrs. Maguire and Garfield - to sustain the integrity of the character, so perhaps the next one needs a new actor to lead? Marvel do have to be careful that gift that keeps on giving - the multi-verse (as with time travel and \"Dr. Who\") is not just mined to oblivion with rehashed theme and plots in future, but as far as this one goes, it's super big-screen cinema that you ought not to be able to dislike.\n",

      "full_review: Before all of the hype I wanted to see Spider-Man in the theater, and the hype just made me want to see it more. I didn't know what to expect, but I certainly expected better than what I saw. Besides being a snooze fest, it was so sappy and saccharin I scheduled a dentist visit during the movie.The movie started going wayward the moment Peter Parker (Tom Holland) went to Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for a spell to make everyone forget him. It wasn't a bad idea for Peter to go to Doctor Strange to fix his little revealed-identity problem, it was just oddly dumb of Doctor Strange to actually accommodate Peter. Doctor Strange truly attempted to make everyone in the world forget who Peter Parker was. It was a massive spell that seemed very excessive just to fix one man's problems. The movie went into silly mode as Parker kept interrupting Doctor Strange as he was doing the spell. The result was a host of old nemeses from different universes converging upon this universe to find Parker. If it was explained, it was explained poorly.At this point the movie was on shaky ground, but it hadn't given way. \"No Way Home\" would suffer another setback when Parker fought Strange to prevent him from sending all of these villains back to their respective universes. You see, if they were to go back then they'd meet death at the hands of, or because of, that universe's Spider-Man, and this universe's Spider-Man was way too moralistic to allow that to happen. No, Parker would fix it so that they could all go back home and they could all live happily ever after.Everything after this part of the movie was immaterial to me in the grand scheme. For me, when a plot is based upon a faulty or simply bad premise, everything that follows is equally faulty and meaningless. Not that the things that follow can't be cool aesthetically; they're just empty.Parker was operating upon the righteous advice of his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei). Per her wisdom, Parker had an obligation to help these poor misguided men, no matter what the exponentially more knowledgeable Doctor Strange said. Doctor Strange wanted to do the most logical thing which was send each villain back to his own universe and let fate take over from there. Parker, with his oversized heart and undersized common sense, wanted to keep them in his own universe as pet projects until he could fix them, then send them back. Nevermind that he was going to be actively tampering with the course of events of another universe thereby massively altering their timelines with untold consequences, he simply wasn't old enough, wise enough, or experienced enough to know what was the best thing to do. Furthermore, it was a slap in the face of the other Spider-Men. As if to say, \"You guys screwed up, I'm going to find a better, more wholesome solution because I'm a better Spider-Man\"I was so thoroughly perturbed by this new mission of Spider-Man's to save these villains that everything after that began to annoy me. The attempts at comedy were awkward and grossly unfunny. The emotional moments were too often and too long. The final nail in the coffin of this was the runtime. Boy did they drag this out. I could put up with a didactic and flawed plot if you get us through it in a quick and exciting way, but in their attempts to have this grand send off for Spider-Man we had to suffer through an ocean of tears, a chasm of emotions, and an abundance of silence with slow music. I left the theater drained and upset as though I'd just been to the DMV. Everything was set up for them to reboot Spider-Man if needed, but at this point I could use a break and no more Spider-Men about \"home.\"\n",

But things go horribly wrong, and the multiverse suddenly gets very real indeed.The trailer reveals the Doctor Octopus from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 makes an appearance, thus linking the MCU with the original Spider-Man franchise, but it is worth watching all 5 pre-MCU movies beforehand because there are moments here which payoff all those movies.This is a very good movie notwithstanding the fan service. It's a good story, the action and effects are first rate, the performances are excellent, and there is a lot of emotion. Far From Home was very good, albeit a more intimate movie after the cosmic goings-on in Infinity War and Endgame, but No Way Home makes it clear that Phase 4 will be as capable of weaving intimate personal issues and massive threats as Phase 3 was.\n",

      "short review: First film I've seen at the theater in over two years...\n",
      "full_review: I believe the last film I watched at the theater was that Lion King remake, but before that it was Spider-man Far From Home. I used to go to the movies all the time, but due to the whole pandemic thing I have not gone in a long while and add to that crippling depression making going out for me a very difficult task. That being said, I am a huge Spider-man fan and I have seen all the Spider-man films in the theater so I managed to get out of the house for my off day from work rather than just staying in bed all day. I was rewarded with a very good film, full of action and nostalgia; however, that being said due to my state of mind it also made me severely sad and a bit suicidal. Just hard for me these days to fully enjoy anything with me growing older and life becoming a pointless endeavor. Still, I enjoyed seeing the old villains, especially Dr. Octopus as he is my favorite Spider-man villain from the comics.The story, Mysterio's message at the end of Far From Home has Peter hounded by the press, taken in by agents and ruins his and his friends MJ and Ned's chances of getting into MIT. So Spider-man goes to Dr. Strange's place where he asks if there is anything the good sorcerer can do. Dr. Strange says he can make everyone forget Spidey's identity, but while in the middle of casting, Spider-man keeps adding stipulations causing the spell to go out of control. Soon enemies of Spider-man from the multiverse emerge and Spider-man must round them up so that they can be sent back; however, our hero soon learns that they are going to die and he wishes to help him despite Dr. Strange's protests. Soon Spider-man finds himself in the need of help as things get there darkest and he finds two other allies to help set things on the correct course.The film is good, but it definitely did not help my depression one bit. Watching the scene where MJ was rescued almost had me burst into tears, as I remembered the scene from one of the other films and remembered my fiance who has since passed away was with me during this time. I also felt alone as Peter was and feel a sense of hopelessness as my life has no meaning, so while a good movie, it probably can hurt someone who is struggling with bad depression as I am. I was honestly hoping for a more happy type film to make me feel a bit cheered up more than one that made me go further down...So a great film, one of the better MCU films and my favorite of Tom Holland's Spider-man films. I honestly, though, would love to see Garfield return to the role for maybe another Amazing film as it was good seeing him as Spider-man again and it would be nice to see some closure for his Spider-man. Heck, I would not mind another Tobey one either as that series never did have full closure either! That one is probably less likely due to Tobey's age though. I will say my only real complaint of the film is the lack of a new villain, this being due to the fact Spider-man has a whole gallery of villains so having a new one would have been easy and would have given the film six Spidey foes making them sort of a Sinister Six! That would have been cool, but still an amazing film all the same.\n",

      "short review: Super holiday entertainment loaded with visual and spiritual meaning.\n",
      "full_review: Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to Peter (Tom Holland): \"The problem is you trying to live two different lives. The longer you do it, the more dangerous it becomes!\"Notwithstanding the \"home\" in the title, the exciting new Spider-Man: No Way Home is more about the existential need to create one's own identity, the Christian need to give up a life in order to gain it, and the human need for a second chance. Many super-hero movies continue to emphasize the hero's need to recover a parent or child even more than the need to sacrifice for the good of humankind.As Peter Parker (Tom Holland) struggles with the attention he gets because Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) revealed his identity, he gets involved with Dr. Strange to erase his super-hero identity from everyone's memory. Fooling with Mother Nature never is good in these hyper-active fantasies, and it's true as Peter tries to get Dr. Strange to reverse his initial memory-erasing spell in order to remain in the minds of those he loves.Besides, what director Jon Watts and his writers are really interested in is pulling the three Spidies together (Holland, Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire) to remediate former bad boys like The Sandman (Thomas Hayden Church), Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), Electro (Jamie Foxx), and Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). Dr. Strange clears the way between parallel dimensions to let each Spidey's version of villains to come together for their cleansing.The imaginative and entertaining concept of getting these characters together proves not to be confusing but revealing of their generous natures and the benign fraternity of Spider-Men, adding the collaboration motif into their otherwise solitary lives.Although the digital gymnastics are impressive, beyond those is an attempt to flesh out character for both good and bad boys. Discoveries abound without super sentimentality or long exposition. Because the filmmakers have taken care to load meaning into most dialogue, the revealing third act takes the plot to dizzying heights while character spills out along the way.As more is found out about the heroes and the villains, the long road back to normalcy for Peter seems just about right, filled as it is with triumphs that come from working as a team (not a normal Spidey thing to do) to suffering the loss of dear ones to a better cause. It's a coming of age at any age and a satisfying display of character development that might be envied by indie films everywhere whose bread and butter is a similar attempt to show humans at their worst and best.Super holiday fare, yes; challenging, yes; amazed I am that comic-book stuff holds meaning amidst its visual splendor, yes.\n",

      "full_review: For the first time in nearly 20 years, I may have seen my favorite Spider-Man movie.And I'm not like a kid who loves the Ice Age movies and since part 17 is the newest one they've seen, it's their favorite. (Much like what they said about the 16 before it.) Nope. I sat from almost the first 10 minutes LOVING this movie and debating if this actually beat out the magnificent 2002's Spider-Man and its even better follow-up, 2004's Spider-Man 2.I will say this: This is my new 2nd favorite of ALL 27 MCU movies. Easy. And it's easily in the top three of the 10 theatrical-released Spider-Man movies. In fact, since part 2 in 2004, I have not been impressed with any of the Spider-Man movies until Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse and this third Tom Holland-led Spider-Man series.I barely liked Tom's Spider-Man: Homecoming and I refer to it Iron Man Jr because it was WAY more about Iron Man smarts and involvement and it clearly made Peter a complete moron who couldn't lift a finger or figure out anything on his own without big-daddy Tony helping. Tom's Spider-Man: Far From Home was better, but it still couldn't let go of Tony (EVEN after his character supposedly left the franchise.) This second rebooted version of Spider-Man of Tom Holland's made me sad, because of how dumb Peter is and how reliant he is on others, namely big-daddy Tony. This is NOT the brilliant Peter Parker I grew up with.But, FINALLY...they got it right with Tom's third movie. The trailer spoiled SO MUCH of this movie and the actors involved, as trailers are designed to be spoiler packed (usually the very last scene of the movie is in the trailer,) so I won't even go into the synopsis or what happens or who's in it. I just HIGHLY encourage you to see this ASAP and know: they FINALLY got Spider-Man right. After 5 disappointing follow-ups to Spider-Man 2, THEY FINALLY GOT SPIDER-MAN BACK ON TRACK.I laughed so hard, even though it wasn't like the traditional MCU movie where it's mostly a comedy. These were genuine jokes and not just inserted to please the audience who apparently wants more comedic MCU movies than action-packed Super-Hero movies. I cried a bit, even though it's mostly an uplifting movie. And yes, I marveled on how well acted and written this film is. Everybody gave it their 110% and no one stole scenes or out-performed anyone else. This was MY Endgame event.I loved this movie so much, I probably will buy it right away on Blu upon release. And to give you a hint of how much that is to me: I don't really buy Blurays anymore due to the convenience of streaming and of ALL 27 MCU movies, I only bought two so far. The rest, I can watch online if I feel like it. Most are forgettable, anyways.I heard they're building a new trilogy with Tom Holland continuing his role as Spidey. To be frank, before this viewing, I almost didn't want to see them. If this turned out just slightly better than Tom's 2nd one which was just slightly better than his mediocre 1st one, I was pretty much done.Now, my Spidey-Sense is tingling to see what they have in store for us next.\n",

      "full_review: Ending a trilogy is typically a monumental task, but what No Way Home accomplished is nothing short of miraculous. What they kept from audiences successfully, the technical feat, the story they put together and most of all the brilliant performances, should be commended for years to come. It's hard to argue with people that this is the best Spider-Man film to date. I still need more time. All I'll say is, 2021 is the most consistently great year Marvel has ever had and we should never doubt their ability ever again.9.5/10.\n",

      "full_review: They did it! A Spider-Man trilogy finally stuck the landing! Spider-Man: No Way Home is an impressive culmination of the films that came before it, with an engaging storyline, exciting action, laugh out loud moments, and dramatic consequences. The beginning climb is a little slow, but it's an exhilarating ride once things get swinging. I don't exactly know how this movie will hold up after multiple viewings, as there are some plot points that don't quite make sense when you start to think about them, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself this first time.\n",

      "full_review: Greetings from Lithuania.I wasn't the biggest fan of previous two movies. I felt they were to independent and carried the weight of Avengers. Yet they were fun entertainment. But this instalment called \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" (2021) was best of the three. If you are a fan of Spider Man in general - go see this on the biggest screen possible, and i will say it no more.Overall, \"No Way Home\" didn't felt like a 2 h 20 min movie because it is superbly entertaining. Directing was terrific due to superb pacing - every minute of this movie wasn't boring or anything. Glad i was it on a big screen - it was superb a escapism, the one that is very needed in this day age of ours.\n",

      "short review: The best Spider-Man movie...\n",
      "full_review: \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" is an Action - Fantasy movie and the third movie of the \"Spider-Man\" franchise, in which we follow the story of Spider-Man after \"Spider-Man: Far from Home\". Everybody knows the true identity of Spider-Man and Doctor Strange can help Peter with a spell. Everything change when this spell goes wrong.I enjoyed this movie very much because it had an amazing plot, contained plenty of action scenes and much of suspense. Regarding the plot, there were some plot twists that I did not expect so, it was a nice surprise and something that made the movie even more interesting and enjoyable. The direction which was made by Jon Watts was very good and he used wisely both information and characters to create this special movie. The interpretations of Tom Holland who played as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Alfred Molina who played as Dr. Otto Octavius / Doc Ock, Benedict Cumberbatch who played as Doctor Strange and Willem Dafoe who played as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin were simply fantastic and their combination worked very well and created an outstanding result. All in all, I have to say that \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" is one of the best Marvel movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it.\n",

      "short review: They pulled it off!\n",
      "full_review: On paper, this film's premise should theoretically crash and burn. Past Spider-Man films have been criticised for stuffing in too many characters and plotlines. This film not only incorporates the main characters from all previous Spider-Man films, it continues their stories while keeping a tight focus on the main storyline. It is an incredibly rewarding experience for fans who are familiar with the whole Spider-Man franchise, yet it goes out of its way to be understandable to casual viewers who have not seen any other Spider-Man films. Truly, an impressive juggling act.The crux of this film is Tom Holland's Peter Parker struggling to have everything he wants, while the world tries to make him choose (as the Green Goblin succinctly puts it). His family life, friendships and career are all in jeopardy because of Mysterio's actions in the previous film. Unfortunately, in his youthful recklessness, he makes things even worse by trying to tamper with reality (not sure what Doctor Strange's excuse is).When the other villains enter from another universe, the results are magnificent. Advances in special effects have made them look exactly as they did years ago, but more dynamic and fluid. The writers have done a good job to make their personalities very consistent with the original films. In some ways, they even exceed their original portrayals. Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin definitely outdoes himself, filling the film with a truly terrifying menace who fights Spider-Man in a disturbing, brutal and violent way.The fan-service doesn't stop at the villains. The much-hyped return of Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire left the audience cheering and screaming, which is rare for New Zealand audiences (I've only seen that in two other films). I was grinning throughout the second half of the film because of the incredibly exciting and cathartic material from filmmakers who clearly understood the original films and what the fans want. All of this is beyond a mere gimmick - by learning from the villains and heroes of other universes, Tom Holland's Spider-Man understands the value of morality, giving people a chance, sacrificing one's personal comfort for the greater good, forgoing revenge and being careful with one's abilities. In other words, with great power comes great responsibility - a lesson often repeated but here demonstrated with the greatest stakes.That said, this film wasn't perfect.While it established the backstories and motivations of the villains quite well, it still remained vague in some places. Max Dillon seemed far more charismatic and power-hungry than his incarnation in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, where he was a mentally deranged loser out for revenge against those who didn't appreciate him. No doubt Jamie Foxx enjoyed playing this newer version of the character, but it seemed inconsistent. The hostile actions of The Lizard and Sandman were also baffling, as it's not clear what they want and they seem to change their minds without explanation.The soundtrack included some leitmotifs from the original films but these were too brief to have any impact. For example, Electro's brilliant theme lasts for about two seconds and then is never heard again.The scenes with three Spider-Men were often endearing and tied back to the original films. However, they dragged on for a bit too long and the emotion started to wear off in favour of humorous banter.Lastly, Dr. Strange's spell seemed contrived, unrealistically idiotic and raises too many questions and plot holes. Does it affect physical evidence like Mysterio's video and Flash's book? How can he possibly be that powerful? Why hasn't he done anything like that before? What exactly do people forget, Spider-Man's identity or Peter Parker's? If it affects everybody without exception, doesn't that mean that Peter Parker forgets about himself?It's an 8.5/10 from me.\n",

      "full_review: 5 out of 5 stars.Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic, big, and one of the best Spider Man films of all time. Literally nothing is holding this film back which the script contains about everything. And director Jon Watts making the best spider man movie ever. Fans and non fans are going to love the film. The story is best to go without any spoilers. There are many surprises that will leave the crowd cheering. Story also goes into an emotional direction and making the film feeling like a conclusion to the trilogy. Characters story arcs coming to an end. While opening up more possibilities to where the direction can go.No Way Home does the third film of concluding the story right unlike Amazing Spider man movie or the original third film where they cram up so many villains and a story that can barely hold it together. No Way Home script managed to balance the story and characters out. This film does have several villains. A lot of returning villains that is a lot of fun surprises and even with a new look. Peter Parker facing each one of them and trying to stop them is awesome. The plot is great. It can try to go in a emotional direction. There is also a fun brief appearance of another character which is cool to see and hoping to see more of them in future mcu films someday.The action sequences are awesome and stylistic. Spider man fight scenes are amazing. The visual effects are brilliant. The cinematography is well done in capturing the action scenes. The music score is different by Michael Giacchino but great. The cast ensemble did a great job. Like I said earlier, the appearances making a return is a lot of fun. For a long run time, the film does feel short and very fast moving which keeps your eyes glued to the screen.The climax battle is epic and exciting. Spider Man facing multiple villains is one of the best action scenes ever. It can be a bit dark. The action scene with Spider Man and Doctor Strange chasing each other through the mirror dimension is stunning.Overall, No Way Home is one of the best Marvel films ever. And one of the best Spider man movies. It is big, epic, and the script and direction had a lot of surprises. I am hoping to see Jon Watts take on another Marvel project.There is a fun mid credit scene that hints for where the direction can go. And a post credit scene that hints of where mcu is going next.\n",

      "short review: The biggest and arguably best Spider-Man outing yet\n",
      "full_review: THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW!There's not much chance of devoted Spidey/Marvel fans walking away from Jon Watt's and Tom Holland's latest web-slinging adventure without a strong sense of satisfaction from an epic outing, that in many ways feels as grand and risky as when the world first wondered how Marvel would manage to bring The Avengers to life all the way back in 2012.The third trip between director Watt's and his leading man, that sees the groundwork laid before it combine here in a loaded and fan servicing collaboration, to talk about No Way Home without giving away its many narrative treasures and likely iconic pop culture moments is a difficult task but there's reason to believe even early on in its release that this Spider-Man outing will go down as one of, if not the best big screen solo outings for the local neighborhood vigilante yet.As is always the case with such loaded Marvel outings, there are a few narrative conveniences that don't hold up to much examination and a few half-explored ideas but too dwell on these moments would be a waste of ones time when there's so much joy, fun and even unexcepted emotion to be found in Watt's film as Parker and his offsiders find themselves battling a severe multiverse problem that threatens to derail the world as we know it.Filled with an abundance of action set pieces, well-known Marvel comedic beats, more throwbacks and nods to lore than almost any other Marvel film before it and fun character interactions, what is perhaps most surprising of all about this high reaching adventure is the wealth of strong performances found within it from one of the most stacked casts the long running superhero brand has seen yet.From the expected and unexpected cast additions, everyone here brings their A-game with Holland and Zendaya as the loving couple getting great moments together and feeling well and truly like they've both become their respective characters in body and soul, while other returning cast members from both recent and less recent times all appear to care more than just a paycheck collection would suggest giving No Way Home a strong sense of purpose and heart, with the small moments making more of an impact than the films various action oriented segments.Likely to be a film that is explored multiple times and one that is sure to provide hidden moments of joy and satisfaction to those that delve back into it across the ensuing years, No Way Home is another groundbreaking achievement from Marvel who could've easily sat back and enjoyed their success after the events of Endgame but have continued to push the boundaries of blockbuster movie making as they keep looking to provide us with top notch entertainment that is undeniable and unmatched in quality.Final Say -There's no doubt about the fact that Spider-Man: No Way Home is the biggest and arguably best Spider-Man outing yet. A stunning achievement in pushing forward while also acknowledging the past, things here might not be perfect but there's too much to like here to deny that Marvel has once more raised the bar for the comic book cinematic landscape.4 imprisoned trees out of 5Check out my film blog Jordan and Eddie for more reviews!\n",

      "full_review: Spider-Man : No Way Home (2021) -\n",
      "Movie Review :The first trilogy of Spider-Man, directed by Sam Raimi, has a special place in everyone's heart. Tobey Maguire's Spidey became a memory, nostalgia for the kids who are adults now. After that so-so, decent Amazing Spider-Man, Marvel Studios brought this popular character in Avengers' Universe with Captain America: Civil War (2014) and MCEU fans went crazy. The Superhero got his own films Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man (2019), which made Tom Holland a household name. These films had that heroic touch of Iron Man (perhaps the most popular Avenger for the Fans), and now we have No Way Home as a whole new crazy Universe post Endgame. If you love Spider-Man movies, if you love Marvel movies, if you love Doctor Strange and if you love all those villains you saw in Spidey films over the years, then you are gonna enjoy this film like a festival. One hell of cobweb it is, and the Superlative Spidey smashes it in style. But, he is not alone. This is Holland's first Spider-Man film where Tony Stark does not appeared, but still he is not alone. Jon Watts, Marvel and Sony have delivered us a Gigantic Blockbuster Spider-Man Saga as a Christmas Present in advance.Spider-Man: No Way Home trailer was full of story, yet it has a lot of surprises stored for the final product. In the end credit scene of Far From Home we saw Parker being exposed, and now in No Way Home he wants people to forget that. He asks Dr. Stephen Strange makes his identity as Spider-Man a secret again with magic but an overload of time dimensions breaks open the multiverse and allows five supervillains from alternate realities to enter Parker's universe. Parker has to battle out the mess he has created and what more surprises he has to offer, must be kept secret by me. Yes, no spoilers at all. They are busy trending #DontSpoilNoWayHome on Twitter and I respect that. Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers' writing keeps you extremely busy during the watch, while the screenplay has no dull moments whatsoever. Just one condition, you don't have to look for the logic because you're watching a Marvel/Sony's Superhero film, not Christopher Nolan's Cinema.Sony and Marvel Entertainment have made a fantastic film like Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse (animation), which may remain unbeatable for years. No Way Home is like a Feature Film version of that intelligently nutty film. If I have to pick the best Feature Film (Superhero) recently, then No Way Home certainly tops the list. Jon Watts brings the madness of multiverse and passion of Spider-Verse together in MCU's Spider-Man No Way Home. A combination that will leave fans screaming out for the repeat watch. No Way Home is packed with solid action, fantastic story, lots of surprises; plenty of Heroic stuff, large size explosions, king-size entertainment and last but not the least, touching emotions. It saves a lot of cliches from becoming cliches. The climax will break the hearts of many Spidey fans but that's where the cinematic magic lies. You need an USP factor beyond that regular commercial potboiler, that's what it is. No Way Home will unite Avengers Fans and old Spidey Fans, and this Union is gonna explode at the box office. As a whole, Spider-Man: No Way Home is a smashing Blockbuster. MCU's most exhilarating entertainer post Endgame phenomena and believe it or not, it has the same amount of fans-crazy hysteria. Just go on hooting, no matter how much the ticket costs because the show worths it.RATING - 7/10*\n",

      "full_review: Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) is a movie my wife and I recently watched in the movies. The storyline follows post Civil War activities when the world discovers Peter Parker is Spider-Man. He approaches Dr. Strange about removing people's memories of him but while Strange is casting the spell Parker interrupts him causing Strange to make a mistake and open a vortex to multiple universes letting in Spider-Man villains from other universes. Can Spider-Man catch the villains and send them back?This movie is directed by Jon Watts (Spider-Man: Homecoming) and stars Tom Holland (The Devil All the Time) , Zendaya (Dune), Benedict Cumberbatch (Star Trek: Into the Darkness), Willem Dafoe (Platoon), Jamie Foxx (Ray), Alfred Molina (Boogie Nights) and Marisa Tomei (My Cousin Vinny).The special effects in this are out of this world as you'd expect from a Marvel movie. The storyline is clever, unpredictable and just the right level of complex with plenty of surprises sprinkled in throughout. The dynamics of the characters are very well presented and the ending is clever and well done and closes the trilogy perfectly. Defoe delivers an incredible performance and this is easily my favorite presentation of Green Goblin yet. All the villains are well done, to be honest. The cast overall does a fantastic job in this picture. This also does a great job of weaving in the holistic Marvel universe characters and themes throughout including an excellent after credits scene.Overall this has an Avengers style grandiose epic feel to it. This and Into the Spider-Verse are the two best Spider-Man movies by far. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.\n",
