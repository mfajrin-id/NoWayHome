      "short review: A great show, despite declining in quality over the years\n",
      "full_review: When I was 10, I adored the Simpsons, America's favourite dysfunctional family. Me and my brother and sisters watched it every day after school, and got a bagful of laughs. Two years ago though, I stopped watching it. Maybe I didn't find it as funny, creative or as original anymore. Well after seeing the Simpsons Movie, I decided to give the show another chance. And I am glad I did, because it is smart, creative, funny AND original. It is true that the show has been declining in written quality the past three years or so, but the more recent seasons are still watchable, thanks to the animation and the endearing characters.The show's animation is fantastic. In animated shows, I like animation that is colourful and fluid, and the animation in this show is exactly that. The theme tune is irresistibly catchy and the story lines are outstandingly good. Other than the voice acting what made the show so good was its writing. Not obnoxious or childish, but smart and most importantly funny. And the visual jokes are also impressive.And the voice acting is exceptional bringing the dysfunctional family to life. Homer is a type of father figure who repeatedly lets down his family, has a love for doughnuts and beer and pretty much hates his job. Dan Castallenetta, a talented voice actor whom I fondly remember as Megavolt from Darkwing Duck, does a great job not only as Homer but as Grandpa and Krusty, not loud and abrasive at all but just right. Julie Kavner is also great as Marge, a caring matriarch who genuinely cares for her family. Nancy Cartwright is perfect as Bart, who is quite naughty and hates school, same with Yeardley Smith as studious Lisa. Plus Maggie is absolutely adorable.Then there are the supporting characters. My favourite is Grandpa, he is absolutely hilarious. Hank Azaria is amusing as Moe and Chief Wiggum, and Harry Shearer is suitably chirpy as Ned and impresses equally with his monotonic drawls for Principal Skinner and Reverend Lovejoy. There are many memorable guest performances from various celebrities, and frequent appearances from Phil Hartmann and Tress MacNeille. My favourite is Kelsey Grammar as Sideshow Bob, a reprising villain I enjoy watching, sinister yet funny. All in all, despite the fact it isn't as enjoyable as it was, The Simpsons is still a great show. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox\n",

      "short review: May be suffering a bit with time  but overall this is one of the finest show to come out of America\n",
      "full_review: The series that follows the dysfunctional family of the Simpsons.  The oafish Homer who can barely go a day without slacking or getting mixed up in crazy adventures. His wife, Marge, who tries to hold it all together.  His duaghter Lisa who is smarter that her gene pool should allow, Bart  every inch the classroom rebel.  The family is rounded out by the youngest  baby Maggie.  The family interact with those around them and learn lessons or sometimes fail to change completely.When this series started in 1987 as a string of rough shorts in Tracey Ulman's show it would be a brave man who would have predicted that over a decade later that this series would be as huge as it is.  However the series got launched with the Christmas special in the early 90's.  The first series saw the animation greatly improved and the characters developed fully to be more involving.  However the story lines were not as sharp or as full as they were to be.  The second series and onwards saw the Simpsons have better stories  often multi-layered stories filled with pop-culture references and background jokes that reward the careful viewer",
      "to try and list them would take ages.For an American sitcom (for that is what it is) this is amazing  the intelligence of the script is fantastic.  The depth of the stories are involving, witty and packed.  For a movie buff like me, this is a gold mine  from sly references in the background to full blow scenes almost spoofing movies this has them all. In some programmes that have background jokes the main stuff at the front often suffers or is ignored totally.  However here the main plot and dialogue is fresh and well thought out  it is amazing that for almost all of it's run The Simpsons rarely had a bad episode.True  recent shows have begun to show a slide in quality but this is to be expected after more than 10 years at the top.  However it is generally brilliant and clever.  After the first series everything improved.  Not only was the series used for political comment, satire and ironic humour (in a country that generally can't do any well) but it is also heart warming and funny.The characters live in a balance between reality and surreality.  They are sort of recognisable as real people in terms of habits and experiences  but in another way they are out there",
      "..Homer has been in Space, stopped a nuclear explosion etc.  The mix of this makes for an unique programme.  What makes it better is that the makers never draw a line between the madness and the normality  one episode is made up of a bad-neighbour type war between Homer and George Bush Snr!  The mix is seamless and adds layers to each show.The wealth of characters is another strength. The main family is strong  even Maggie has regular input and adventures!  However where most sitcoms really rely on their main subjects for the stories, The Simpsons has a supporting cast of dozens and dozens of really good characters  all of whom are able to carry an episode.  They range from the normal characters (an inept  Police Chief, an Asian shop keeper who is used to being robbed at gunpoint) to the referential or well imagined, (the well-educated Sideshow Mel, a bitter Krusty the Clown, an useless lawyer).  All the characters have become more fully used as time has gone on.The voice actors are all excellent and all do a huge range of voices",
      "of course they get very well paid for it!  Unfortunately the late Phil Hartman provided the voices of two of my favourite characters and I really miss his dry humour and strong all-American voice.  Lionel Hutz was a great character and my favourite, Troy McClure is a wonderful spoof of 60's B-movie actor Doug McClure.  This depth really helps the show and has allowed it to feel so very fresh years on.I could go on for ever, but the series is a wonderful bit of proof that sitcoms don't have to be simple, full of canned laughter and focus on sassy teenagers!  The joys of the dialogue are backed up by movie references and crazy adventures.  The wonderful Simpson family are supported by a huge cast of imaginative characters who are always well used and a queue of celebrities just lining up to have a few minutes in the show. Quite simply this is consistently the best show to come out of American in my life time.\n",

      "short review: The greatest show ever\n",
      "full_review: Ever since I started watching \"The Simpsons\" when it first started, it has been my favorite show. They just make fun of EVERYTHING! Aside from the fact that there are an infinite number of pop culture references and spoofs, they always look at current issues. Whether it's anti-immigrant sentiment, jingoism or gay marriage that passes through Springfield (the semi-fictional city where the show happens), you can count on \"The Simpsons\" to do something about it.And the characters. Homer is the D'oh-grunting, dim-witted, beer-guzzling, TV-obsessed, short-tempered, dangerously overweight dad. No matter what happens, he always comes close to screwing up everyone's existence. His constant injuries are pure belly laughs.Marge is the ever-concerned mom with hair shaped like a cactus. As everyone in the family often gets into some kind of trouble, she always has to scold them, usually unsuccessfully. Also, she always has some complaint for the local government, whether or not they listen to her.Bart is dude-saying, skateboarding, Krusty- and Itchy-and-Scratchy- and Radioactive-Man-obsessed, El-Barto-spray-painting son. His abundant pranks tend to get someone in trouble. His best pranks are of course his uncouth phone calls to Moe's Tavern, which result in massive embarrassment for Moe.Lisa is the left-wing, vegetarian, Buddhist, sax-playing daughter. As the only true intellectual in the family, she is often the one who gets the family out of trouble. She is always involved in the latest political cause (including tree-sitting).Maggie is the pacifier-sucking baby. Naturally, there is little to say about her...or is there? As for the other characters, there is Abe, the grandfather who tells dubious stories about his exploits; Patty and Selma Bouvier, Marge's sullen, DMV-operating sisters;Ned Flanders, the excessively pious neighbor;Principal Seymour Skinner, a Vietnam veteran with a tyrannical mother; Edna Krabappel, Bart's half-attentive teacher who is usually having an affair with Skinner; Groundskeeper Willie, the janitor who never lets anyone forget his Scottish heritage;Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, the Kwik-e-Mart owner who sells the unhealthiest food; Moe Szyzlak, the crude-mannered barkeep whose attempts at relationships are overshadowed by Bart's prank phone calls;Mr. Burns, the power plant owner who epitomizes the crass capitalist;Waylon Smithers, Mr. Burns' very gay lackey; Lenny Leonard and Carl Carlson, Homer's co-workers who may or may not have something going;Julius Hibbert, the physician who chuckles at inappropriate times; Tim Lovejoy, the drawling reverend; John Frink, the buck-toothed scientist who seems like a cross between the \"Gilligan's Island\" professor and any character from \"Revenge of the Nerds\"; Comic Book Store Guy, always obsessed with \"Star Trek\" or anything else involving androids; Joe Quimby, the John Kennedy-esque mayor who has a million affairs and is always beholden to the mafia; Clancy Wiggum, the corrupt police chief who finds more time to eat donuts than to arrest criminals; Krusty the Klown, the kid-appealing clown who makes a whole array of dangerous products; Kent Brockman, the sour and oft biased anchorman; Rainier Wolfcastle, the Arnold Schwarzenegger-esque movie star who appears in the most idiotic action flicks; Fat Tony, the local mafioso who can buy out any authority figure; Milhouse Van Houten, Bart's geeky, bespectacled friend; Nelson Muntz, the school bully who always has a soft side;Martin Prince, the school nerd who remains eternally stuck up; and Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II, the Simpsons' dog and cat, respectively.Like I said, the whole show just makes fun of everything. Their best episodes are at Halloween (examples: Bart resurrects zombies, Homer becomes 3-D, and a Harry Potter spoof). What's really good about the show is that all the characters are flawed, but they're all well-meaning. Except for Mr. Burns. He's consistently malicious, doing things such as blocking out the sun so that the whole city has to buy power from him.So, that's why \"The Simpsons\" is, and always will be, my favorite TV show. One change that I have noticed is that the show used to be more Bart-centric, but is now more Homer-centric. But that's okay. I recommend \"The Simpsons\" to anyone and everyone!\n",

      "short review: The Simpsons\n",
      "full_review: This is one of, if not the best show there has been in the history in television, especially from America. The greatest cartoon ever made started in 1989, and it's still going on. The Simpsons are the family that live in the town of Springfield. The Simpsons family is a 10-year-old son, Bart; an 8-year-old daughter, Lisa; a baby daughter, Maggie; a mother and wife, Marge; and of course, television and the programme's greatest character, the stupid, lazy, sometimes rude and disgusting father/husband, Homer Simpson. Throughout the show the family have many weird and wonderful adventures, happenings and goings on. All funny, lovable and brilliant stories are what keep the show going. Homer is obviously the biggest story maker of the show. There are also some lovable characters in the extended family and neighbourhood to like, including Abraham \"Grampa\" Simpson, Patty and Selma, Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II, The Flanders: Ned, Maude, Rod and Todd, Milhouse Van Houten, Apu, Ralph Wiggum, Chief Clancy Wiggum, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Martin Prince, Reverand Lovejoy, Nelson Muntz, Cletus and Brandine, Mr. Charles Montgomery Burns and Waylon Smithers, Lenny and Carl, Principal Seymour Skinner, Superintendent Chalmers, Edna Krabappel, Grounsdkeeper Willie, Otto Mann, Jimbo, Dolph, Kearney, Mayor \"Diamond Joe\" Quimby, Snake, Fat Tony, Comic Book Guy, Sea Captain (MacCallister), Lionel Hutz, Squeaky Voiced Teen, Professor Frink, Hans Moleman, Krusty the Clown, Itchy and Scratchy (in TV cartoons), Kent Brockman, Troy McClure, Rainier Wolfcastle (who plays McBain), Bleeding Gums Murphy, Moe the bartender, Barney Gumble, Dr. Nick Riviera, Dr. Marvin Monroe, and many more. Stars of these voices are Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, This Is Spinal Tap's Harry Shearer, Hank Azaria, Pamela Hayden, Tress MacNeille, Marcia Wallace, Maggie Roswell, Russi Taylor, Joe Mantegna and Phil Hartman (till his death).The other reason the show is so popular is that it is the cartoon sitcom with the most celebrity appearances. These include: Kelsey Grammar as 'Sideshow Bob', James Earl Jones, Jon Lovitz, Danny DeVito as Herbert Powell (Homer's half-brother), Frank Welker, Ringo Starr, Dustin Hoffman, Sting, Bob Hope, Sir Tom Jones, Bette Midler, Hugh Hefner, Dame Elizabeth Taylor (as herself and Maggie (once), Brooke Shields, Barry White, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sam Neill, James Woods, Kathleen Turner, James Taylor, Winona Ryder, Meryl Streep, Woody Harrelson, Patrick Stewart, Mel Brooks, Susan Sarandon, Sir Paul McCartney, Glenn Close as Homer's Mom, Donald Sutherland, Kirk Douglas, Jeff Goldblum, Christina Ricci, Johnny Cash, David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, Jack Lemmon, Willem Dafoe, Martin Sheen, Jay Leno, Helen Hunt, Rod Steiger, Bono, Steve Martin, Lisa Kudrow, Robert Englund, Jerry Springer, Alec Baldwin, Kim Basinger, Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, Mark Hamill, Sir Elton John, Stephen Hawking, Mel Gibson, John Goodman, Tim Robbins, Britney Spears, Jim Cummings, Parker Posey, Gary Coleman, Buzz Aldrin, Stephen King, Drew Barrymore, Michael Keaton, Serena and Venus Williams, Justin Timberlake, Pierce Brosnan, Matthew Perry, Paul Newman, Richard Gere, Delroy Lindo, Ben Stiller, Reese Witherspoon, Stan Lee, Carmen Electra, Elvis Costello, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Tony Bennett, Burt Ward, Adam West, Elliot Gould, Pamela Reed, Tony Hawk, Helen Fielding, James L.

Macy, Michael York, Ricky Gervais (who also wrote his episode), Joe Pantoliano and so many more.If you've never watched this, you should, it is just the most outstanding cartoon and sitcom ever created. Winner of and nominated for numerous awards including 3 British Comedy Awards, 6 ASCAP Film and TV Music Awards, 23 Annie Awards and 20 Emmys, through seventeen years on TV! A movie will be coming out in 2007! It was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, it was number 12 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments (for all Christmas episodes), it was number 1 on The 100 Greatest TV Characters (for Homer Simpson), it was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Kids' TV Shows, and of course, it was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons.

While there had been animated comedies before, these were largely cartoons, involving physical comedy (think Micky Mouse, or the Roadrunner). The Simpsons brought well thought out plots, dialogue and clever humour. These effects can be seen today, in every animated comedy show.

      "full_review: I am mainly reviewing this up to the 7th year(and I own the sets up to and including that one). I will admit that the very first of this wasn't all great... drawings were crude, it was \"messy\", and it leaned towards the sappy/hokey on occasion... but it did have moments. And right after, from the beginning of the second season, this was an amazing show. The animation got to be rather good just about immediately. The writing more often than not packed with social commentary, sometimes silly, though with little to no exceptions, funny. This is consistently well-done, almost entirely invariably. The references(to everything in and outside of showbiz, within the last several decades) are typically well-done, and this was self-aware and sophisticated. The characters are relate-able, flawed and credible. The comedy usually steered clear of toilet humor and material tends to go for the smart, satirical gag. The show maintained a high level until the eighth or so, when it started to go downhill. Since then it merely seems to grow worse with each successive effort. The jokes(which really aren't worth much to begin with, even the few of them that aren't solely based on public humiliation, other disgusting stuff and/or physical pain/abuse) have multiple punchlines, go against the canon for no good reason, and they practically spell out how sucky this has gotten. The DVDs hold special features such as animatics, alternate language reels, deleted scenes, a commentary track for every individual collection of 22 minutes of fun(with relevant people who worked on them, and, if not always, actors), and crew people either sharing inside information or introducing the extras/episodes, and they tend to be worth your time. I realize that my criticism of the recently aired of this might lead some to avoid this altogether, so I suggest anyone considering it to not do so(and heck, if you do like even the new, have at it), or you would give up many hours of hilarious, finger-on-the-pulse cleverness. And that would be downright nutty. I heartily recommend this to anyone who enjoys laughing and has enough of a base of knowledge of pop culture and American society from the 80's through the 90's. 8/10\n",

Unfortunately that show ended but this show has thrived with some of the cast mates like Julie Kavner and Dan Castellnata as Marge and Homer Simpson. Being an animated show has it's advantages though, gone are those silly actors and actresses because you only need voices. The show works because of the powers behind the show's success. Maggie is still a baby, Bart is still a brat, and Lisa is well the middle child who is smart. The fact that the producers decided to maintain the characters in the same age for 20 years is an achievement in itself. In live sitcoms, the children age and stories change and attention shifts from one character to another. There are episodes that are good and plentiful. They have done everything from Shakespeare to Edgar Allen Poe. I don't know how long this show will run but as long as the audience wants more. They'll be happy to comply.\n",

The writers are having a hard time finding new material, but keeps fresh with modern day social humor.  Homer can be a little too much at times.  The show pushes against Political correctness to the limit.  The only weak character is the Doctor, I know it is a poke at \"the cosby show\" but hey that show has been off the air for over 11 year and a lot of viewers miss that punch line.  It's getting too old.  My favorite episode is the time travel one with Homer.  Only problem, with the show's popularity, is the over play of reruns.  I am starting to become sick of the over played episodes, and it will become another MASH.  MASH used to be shown 7 days a week like the the Simpsons.  It is too bad, we had to wait for 4 years for it to come to Canada. You see a lot of Conan O'Brien humor in both shows.\n",

I have no idea why I didn't stick with this show, even as I grew up with it, but I've certainly made up for lost time, and it's become one of my favorite series. The array of memorable characters, the sly wit, it's all here and consistently funny - which is not something I can say about any other FOX animated sitcom. One other thing: Hank Azaria is an American treasure. The series itself is a showcase of incredible talent (Shearer and Castellaneta, especially), but it's Azaria's characters that tend to be my favorite (Moe and Chief Wiggum). I love that Wiggum is a bad Edward G. Robison impression, and he never says something that's not funny. 9/10\n",

      "full_review: The Simpsons is the longest running animated TV series since The Flinstones, and you could understand why after watching just one of the Simpsons episodes. Simply because The Simpsons is just so hilarious and incredibly clever and has been ripped off so many times, but nothing has come close to the brilliance that the Simpsons writers have brought us.We have Homer Simpson, one of the most beloved TV characters of all time, with his famous quote \"Doh!\". He's an overweight, lazy, and not the brightest bulb, but so incredibly lovable for the fact of how bipolar he is! One minute he can be so incredibly depressed, but the next minute really happy and giggling. My favorite Homer quote is when he kills the zombie Ned Flanders in a Halloween episode, Bart tells him \"Dad! You killed the zombie Flanders!\"... \"He was a zombie?\" Marge is Homer's wife and a homemaker. She is at times naggy, but always manages to get in some terrific humor and some deep sympathy with all she puts up with. My favorite Marge quote is \"Bart, don't make fun of grad students. They've just made a terrible life choice.\" Bart is the oldest son and a rebel. His usual quotes are \"Don't have a cow\" \"Cool, man!\" \"Ei Carumba!\". He's this generation's Dennis the Menace. My favorite Bart quote is \"I need a soul, Ralph, any, your's!\", you'll see what I mean.Lisa is the second oldest and the smartie pants of the Simpson clan, she's kind of the know it all who solves all the adventures of the Simpsons. My favorite Lisa quote is \"They're only using you for your pool you know... shut up brain! I have friends now, I don't need you any more!\". Last, but not least, Maggie, the eternal baby of Homer and Marge, always a great love of the screen, but no famous quotes, just memorable moments like when she turns into an alien.The supporting cast is a terrific addition, my favorites include Mr. Burns, Homer's boss, Groundskeeper Willy, the school janitor, and Mr. Skinner, the school principal. The Simpson is just a terrific show that in one way or another you will see at least one episode in your lifetime. I know that generations to come, they will still be watching The Simpsons.\n",

      "full_review: Kowabunga!! The characters are all classics on this show. What this show does so well when you watch it a lot is defines it's characters sharply & throw in so much comedy that the throw away lines are even great. When you watch this enough & think Bart, Homer, Marge, Lisa, Maggie, Moe, Crusty the Clown, Montgomery Burns, & Abu (among others), you get a mental picture of the character & sometimes see people in your real life who resemble them. Some of the resemblance is deliberate when you consider Matt Gronig's mind. Some of it is happen stance.Regardless, the show will always have its critics because it does shoot from the hip & hit raw nerves about almost any subject. In truth, it is that edge that makes it great. It takes any topic & lampoons it. It recreates great scenes from past TV & movies & lampoons them. Nothing is sacred on the Simpons. That's Funny!!!\n",

      "full_review: Just the fact that a show like the SIMPSONS has been on so long- almost 14 years-proves that it is a great comedy achievment. Who would've honostly thought such a show would be embraced by millions. I know a lot of shows like the SIMPSONS that are canceled, just because they aren't given a chance-especially on FOX.The characters are wonderfl, and the whole cast is voiced by a few people, disguising their voice (Dan Castenella does tons of voices, his most famous HOMER SIMPSON). For example, did you know Bart is voiced by a female? That I find is funny, because he really does act and sound like a little bratty but loveable character. So turn on the tv and get ready, set, D'OH! 4.5/5 starsJOHN ULMER----D'OH!\n",

      "short review: The Post-Modern \"Human Comedy\", by Matt Groening...\n",
      "full_review: You can cancel \"Games of Thrones\" or \"Family Guy\" and nobody would care, but the heart of soul of Television is",
      " (clouds separating) The Simpsons.After three decades (can you believe it?), Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie and all Springfield's townspeople went the distance, resisting criticism even from fans of the first hour. The show didn't let itself dictated by fans, a mistake most sitcoms do, but on the contrary, found the way to precede their own tastes and expectations. Of course, nothing will ever beat the magical 90's, a time were the Simpsons influenced Pop Culture before Pop Culture would influence them, but you can't expect something that spans three decades not to evolve the slightest bit, format and style-wise. And it's a credit to Matt Groening, son of Homer Groening, not to just have come up with the simplest yet most ingenuous concept (something he put on the paper in less than thirty minutes in a waiting room, borrowing names from his own relatives), but to have made it last. And it lasted because it evolved, however unpleasant some changes were. Just take Walt Disney, the show's regular punching ball and check for yourself the differences between \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" and \"The Sword in the Stone\", 26 years later. Now, speaking from my experience, I had to wait till the mid-90's before watching the first episodes. So it was a late discovery, but I watched the show starting with the first seasons, and since I was raised by 80's sitcoms like \"The Cosby Show\", \"Who's the Boss\" or \"Growing Pains\", I loved to see an animated series that carried much more depth and realism than all these live-action programs combined. It was just, to use a hackneyed term, like watching your family in a mirror. Indeed, Bart was the bratty underachiever with a good conscience, Marge was the loving and hardworking housewife, Homer the well-meaning, sometimes idiotic, sometimes hot-tempered father and Lisa, the voice of reason. It was just fine, and I was cringing whenever something 'unrealistic' happened, Maggie sleeping with bears, an angry mob wanting to kill Bart after he decapitated Jebediah Springfield's statue, Homer spectacularly falling in the stairs in \"Crepes of Wrath\" or Bart's slavery in the same episode. I was thinking, can't they make an episode like \"Moaning Lisa\" for instance? Yeah right, \"Moaning Lisa\"!After Season 1, I hoped it would never get over the top and spoiled that trademark realism . Guess what happened after? The channel aired Season 5, so talk about a chronological leap, so many new characters from the Mayor to the Comic Book Guy, and so many ludicrous plots. I hated every single one of them, even the classic \"Cape Fear\" and the racks scene annoyed me like you can't imagine. I was done with the show. I feel ridiculous now, but the funny thing is that many comments on the Internet capsule expressed similar doubts, and it was years before the official \"Pauper\"s shark-jumping episode, a time deemed now as Golden Age. A few months after, I bumped into an episode of Season 2, and I thought it was surprisingly good: realistic, warm and funny with a little touch of zaniness. Season 2 is still my favorite season because it revived my love for the show, one that never faded, and it featured some of the most classic moments: \"Bart the Daredevil\"'s unforgettable climax, the Fugu episode, Homer meeting Marge, Bart crying after getting an F and my all-time favorite, \"Lisa's Substitute\" (Homer's finest hour at the end makes it one of the best twist endings of the series). Season 3 and 4 were, as Burns would say, excellent, and when the 5th season was re-run, I finally enjoyed the episodes because I could see the transition. After that, I think we can all agree that the chances of being disappointed hugely dropped and Season 6-7-8 provided some of the best episodes of the show: \"Lisa the Vegetarian\", \"Homer the Great\" or \"You Only Move Twice\" to name a few.But that never stopped the criticism, and after the \"Principal and Pauper\" episode, no one would've bet a penny on one more decade, and the following seasons made it even worse. Now, Season 11 is a classic full of so many great moments such as the octuplets' birth, Maude's death and the cow mooing \"Tomacco!\". Many episodes aged very well, and that's a credit to the writers' talent. Even the then- detestable \"Saddlestore Galactica\" is now regarded as a brilliant episode full of tongue-in-cheek humor from the authors, telling fans, we understand what you don't like but you better get used to it, because that's the new way of the Simpsons  And let's admit it, wouldn't we watch the so hilariously over-the-top \"Marge vs. the Monorail\" rather than \"Moaning Lisa\"? In the late 90's and early 2000's most animated shows were satirical, pushing very far the parody button. The Simpsons didn't wait for \"South Park\" or \"Family Guy\" before making 'crazy humor' the rule rather than the exception. Of course, now, Homer became the main character, Lisa's liberalism became annoying and Marge isn't much of a character (there must be more episodes centered on Moe than Marge alone) but there was always a reason or a combination of reasons for all these changes.In the end, \"The Simpsons\" created characters, places, catchphrases, songs and words, a whole parallel universe that isn't just part of America's Pop Culture but the world, imagine that almost a quarter of the population was born when the Simpsons already existed, it's an era-defining phenomenon just like Chaplin or the Beatles, of the same epic scale as the Human Comedy by Honore de Balzac, tailor-made for the TV format and liable to evolve in the most disconcerting ways, like we all do. These are facts and they transcend personal opinions, so, don't have a cow and enjoy the show, and if you feel 'meh' about it, remember THEY popularized this word.\n",

      "short review: This Show Will Be Used to Study How Life Was 100 Years From Now\n",
      "full_review: Brilliant television series that could probably be best described as \"The Flintstones\" gone stark-raving mad. \"The Simpsons\", everyone knows them. Some love the series and some could care less about it. Love it or hate it, it is near impossible to criticize the intelligence and creativity of this series. The titled animated family makes their home in Springfield, USA and gets into situations that are seemingly more outlandish and crazier than the previous adventure. Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are still going strong after nearly a dozen years of television life and with each passing moment it seems that the series sets some new precedent. For several years the show seemed to be the only attraction to the then obscure Fox Network. It was the first primetime animated show that was treated like a sitcom since \"The Flintstones\" quietly left the air in 1966. Many people feared the series when it first premiered in 1989 because they felt that it was hardcore adult material in a candied form that would appeal to younger audiences. Well for the most part this was true. However, \"The Simpsons\" would prove to be much more for all audiences. The great thing about the series is that it caters to all audiences. True there are usually situations that may not be suitable for all viewers, but then again that is true with everything on television this side of Disney Land and Sesame Street. \"The Simpsons\" works because of great comedy of course, but also great lessons that can be taken from most of the episodes. The people within the program may be animated, but they are just as complicated and vulnerable as the people watching them. All the regulars have their quirks, but in some episodes you can understand what certain characters are going through because the show is so life-like at times. Former President George Bush (the one from 1988-1992) once made a statement that families should be more like \"The Waltons\" and less like \"The Simpsons\". His opinion is somewhat old-fashioned and unrealistic. In other words, many topics dealt with in \"The Simpsons\" fit life for people in the 1990s and 2000s better than \"The Waltons\" did in the 1970s. A crowning achievement in television art. 5 stars out of 5.\n",

      "full_review: I grow up as a young lad, watching the simpson everyday. Reruns after reruns and I loved every moment of it.I remember when there were days of a full day simpsons marathon.Simpsons were a household name. Everyone was talking about the simpsons.Simpsons were the mcu of old.Simpsons were funny, emotional, you learned stuff and it was a show families could sit and watch without crude violence and sexualization.Now in 2020 the last time I even seen an episode of the simpons was probably in 2006. I mean i've seen clips and I was not happy about what I saw. It was just too whacky.I don't even have to watch it and I know thing aren't right. The Simpsons are not the same show it was 20 years ago. Obviously shows need to reboot and change and i get that.But if you have been running for 30+ years and most of your old fans aren't watching. New audience memebers don't care.Its time to move on. There is nothing left in the tank. If there is no one really cares.2021 update: thanks to Disney plus I had a chance rewatch some classic Simpsons episodes. I have not watched the Simpsons in 2 decades.The Simpsons is a dumb, unfunny show. Homer is a horrible annoying character.Simpsons is hash and trash. It went from a 10 to a 1. I felt really stupid watching this show.Verdict: GoodBye Simpsons. I would give it a 3 for todays work. However since the simpsons are a staple in my childhood. It get a big fat 10.\n",

      "short review: From those little \"In Betweeners\" on the TRACY ULLMAN Show to perhaps the longest running Series in TV History!\n",
      "full_review: Animated Film or \"Cartoons' have long been part of the motion world. Their magical movement and \"life\" has been the instrument of so much laughter, tears and all round amazement, tons of it. From HUMOROUS PHASES OF FUNNY FACES (Vitagraph Co., 1906) right down through the heyday of ROGER RABBIT(1988) and beyond, the animated film has been there providing us with an alternate film Universe; another dream world for other dreams.For the longest time, the animated \"Cartoon\" has been branded by some as being strictly (non-greasy) \"Kids' Stuff.\" That rap's being hung on them doubtless dates from the early days of commercial Telecasts in the late 1940's and early 1950's, when so many local Stations broadcast Noontime, late Afternoon and Saturday Morning programming aimed at Children. Beyond their assortment of various \"Aunts\", \"Uncles\", Cowboys, Clowns and Puppets of varying ilk; they had to fill out their on air time. But with what would they do, what could be used to fill up the shows? As a diversion from the live action, the Stations made use of what ever short films that could be purchased, rented or leased for a price within their budgets. The films available fell into 2 basic types. The first group featured the likes of Snub Pollard, Harry Langdon, Our Gang, Mickey (Himself) McGuire, The 3 Tons of Fun Harry Langdon, the Keystone Kops and Charlie Chase. These were live action silent comedies.The second group was made up of old silent and early sound animated short subjects. Their sources were many and varied. There were silent with sound track added; containing music, sound effects and occasional words. Paul Terry's Farmer Al Falfa was much in evidence; as were productions of the then defunct Van Beueren Studios. Those cartoons were those featuring \"Cubby Bear\" and \"a human Mutt and Jeff team of \"Tom And Jerry\", not the MGM Cat & Mouse team. And of course, there were many others; a lot of them released to Television by 'Official Films' (as opposed to any Un-Official Films that may be lying about.) Eventually of course, in God's good time, original TV Cartoons were produced. Those such as Alexander Anderson & Jay Ward's CRUSADER RABBIT. Hanna-Barbera's RUFF & REDDY, HUCKLEBERRY HOUND, YOGI BEAR, etc. and Terrytoons' TOM TERRIFIC, DEPUTY DAWG and others did make it out to our living rooms via the Networks. These were mainly done for the kids. (Although, once again, any Jay Ward Production has an appeal to all ages.) And that brings us down the Video Evolutionary Track to THE SIMPSONS. Now, even though animated, even the most vehemently anti-cartoon old grouch would have to concede the point to us that this is not just child's fare.In short, THE SIMPSONS is the story of a totally dysfunctional American Family; being representative of the typical family. The 5 Simpsons are the Homer (father), Marge (Mother), Bart (Son & Star), Lisa (Sister) and Maggie (Infant Sister). Together with their various and sundry pets, neighbors, friends and co-workers have an incredibly high number of adventures, which can be and are limitless in scope and locale. From week to week it isn't uncommon to see either Homer or Marge taking to a new profession or running for public office. Their home town of Springfield has an everyman's geological set up; being bordered by mountains, forests, desserts, rivers, canyons and whatever else the particular story requires. In short, it is boundless and all encompassing. It is a town that is as vast or as deep as imagination, itself.There are some who criticize the characterization of Homer as an uncouth, swill slugging vulgarian. Their line of reasoning being that a poor example of American Family and an even poorer example of a fictional Father figure than was Carroll O'Connor's 'Archie Bunker.' To those critics, we can only say that they should take time and carefully watch and even more meticulously listen to the damn thing! Even though it may appear on the surface that the admittedly dysfunctional (to say the least) family would be a poor example to put on exhibit, albeit a comic version of one.If one stops to take inventory of the individual episodes, their themes and presentations, they'd certainly see things far differently. For believe it or not, the Simpsons present us with a fine example of an American Family, as viewed through the multi lensed spectrum Of a comedy series that, even though it's a \"Cartoon\", has a lot to say. For underneath it all, with all the gags, funny business and wacky plots; we find some very decent, \"old fashioned\" and important virtues that we would do well in remembering.As just one example, an important one is the down to earth relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, Marge and Homer. No matter how wacky the plot or how far aground the story takes the Family Simpson, in the end we see how much they really do love each other and are always there when their mate needs the other.Honest folks, just try it for yourselves, soon!\n",
